New.  Exciting.  Challenging.  In-demand.

Allows for creativity, collaboration, critical thinking, and innovative problem solving.

But more than anything, I love to code.  Plus the pay doesn't hurt either.

Like most Flatiron students my path to software development is both easy and hard.  On one hand I'm living a dream opportunity by getting to try something new while also practicing a fundamental belief of mine:  continued learning.  That's easy.  The hard part is embracing career change, uncertainty, and the possibility of failure.

Prior to Flatiron School I worked as an aerodynamics engineer at Space Exploration Technologies (SpaceX) where I was responsible for developing external flowfield environments for the Falcon family of rockets during all phases of flight.  In addition to conducting wind tunnel tests, I performed computational analyses for reentry vehicles as part of the SpaceX reusable launch system program.

If the job sounds cool -- it was.  But like all good things coming to an end, this adventure recently concluded with a cross-country move to be closer to family (nice to have helping hands when your own family grows by one).  :)

Feeling inspired by the fresh start not to mention the lack of employment options in rocket science for most areas, I've decided to try my hand at something new.  Motivated primarily by my love of coding, I'm excited to delve into the world of software development and look forward to the journey ahead.  Stay tuned for more blog posts regarding my experiences at Flatiron School!
